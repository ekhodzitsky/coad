# Normative Language

COAD documents use normative keywords to separate rules from guidance.

## Keywords

- **MUST**: required for conformance.
- **MUST NOT**: prohibited for conformance.
- **SHOULD**: recommended unless there is a documented reason not to.
- **SHOULD NOT**: discouraged unless there is a documented reason.
- **MAY**: optional.

Lowercase uses of these words are ordinary English and not normative.

## Conformance

A project conforms to COAD when it can show:

- required contracts exist for the chosen adoption level;
- required fields are present;
- proof requirements are explicit;
- missing proof is visible debt;
- task acceptance follows proof and review contracts;
- integration readiness follows the integration contract.

## Agent Norms

An agent working under COAD:

- MUST read the assigned task contract before editing;
- MUST preserve or update affected module contracts;
- MUST NOT silently widen write scope;
- MUST NOT claim completion without proof required by the task;
- SHOULD propose follow-up task contracts for work outside scope;
- MAY return a blocker when policy or proof is insufficient.

## Orchestrator Norms

An orchestrator using COAD:

- MUST bind work to task contracts;
- MUST enforce dependencies and write-scope conflicts;
- MUST provide bounded context packs;
- MUST collect proof and handoff artifacts;
- MUST block readiness when required proof is missing;
- SHOULD convert blocking review findings into task contracts;
- MAY accept known debt only when policy allows it and evidence records the risk.
