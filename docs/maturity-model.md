# Maturity Model

COAD should be adopted incrementally.

## Level 0: Uncontracted

Modules have ordinary docs or no docs. Agents rely on repository search and chat context.

Exit criteria:

- identify ownership boundaries worth contracting.

## Level 1: Described

Important modules have purpose and surface documented.

Exit criteria:

- module purpose is clear;
- primary surface is listed;
- obvious owners or consumers are named.

## Level 2: Connected

Contracts include dependencies and consumers.

Exit criteria:

- internal and external dependencies include scope and reason;
- known consumers are listed;
- cross-module changes can be traced.

## Level 3: Proof-Backed

Contracts include invariants and proof.

Exit criteria:

- key invariants are explicit;
- each surface and invariant has proof or visible missing proof;
- verification commands exist.

## Level 4: Agent-Ready

Contracts include agent policy and change-class proof rules.

Exit criteria:

- allowed and forbidden mutations are listed;
- escalation conditions are explicit;
- task contracts can bind to module contracts;
- agents can work from bounded context packs.

## Level 5: Orchestrated

Contracts are enforced by tooling or process.

Exit criteria:

- drift checks run;
- proof matrix gates acceptance;
- review findings become task contracts;
- integration contracts decide final readiness;
- metrics track missing proof, drift, conflicts, and review pass rate.
