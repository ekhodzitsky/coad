# Conformance Profile

`COAD_PROFILE.json` declares the methodology level this repository claims to
support. `coad check .` verifies that claim through its internal report checks.

## Current Level

The current profile is `ledger_audited_orchestration`.

This means the repository has:

- validated contract schemas and graph references;
- schedulable task waves;
- execution ledgers audited against task proof contracts;
- release gates and drift checks wired into CI.

## Checks

Each profile check has an `id`, tool, requirement flag, and description.
Required checks must pass for the repository to be conformant.

Current required checks:

- `contracts-valid`;
- `schedule-builds`;
- `execution-ledger-verified`;
- `policy-enforced`;
- `release-gates-clean`.

## Local Verification

```bash
coad check .
```
